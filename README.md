## ðŸ“œ Guide to Writing a Sample Prompt
The plugin supports structured prompts to generate AI content effectively. Below is a sample JSON configuration with explanations:

### **ðŸ”¹ Default Settings**
These settings apply to all prompts unless overridden:
```json
{
    "default_settings": {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "max_tokens": "1500",
        "timeout": "30",
        "system_content": "You are an expert writer specializing in technology topics. Return articles in JSON format. The response must strictly follow this structure: { \"title\": \"Article Title\", \"content\": \"Full article content...\", \"excerpt\": \"A short summary of the article...\", \"references\": [ {\"title\": \"Source 1\", \"link\": \"https:\/\/example.com\/source1\"}, {\"title\": \"Source 2\", \"link\": \"https:\/\/example.com\/source2\"} ] }"
    }
}
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Example Prompts**
```json
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "text": "You are an expert writer specializing in technology. Search the internet for the latest advancements in AI and generate a well-structured, SEO-optimized article. Ensure the article is engaging, fact-based, and up to date. Provide a clear and compelling title.",
            "category": "AI Research",
            "active": "1"
        },
        {
            "text": "Write an article summarizing the latest statistics on cybersecurity breaches, covering affected companies, financial losses, and mitigation strategies. Ensure readability by structuring the content effectively and integrating insights from official data sources.",
            "max_tokens": "1200",
            "category": "Cybersecurity",
            "active": "1"
        },
        {
            "text": "Write an engaging article with fun facts about space exploration. Use simple but captivating language. Within the article, insert a placeholder in the following format {img_unsplash:keyword1,keyword2,keyword3} using the most relevant keywords for fetching related images from Unsplash. We need at least 2 photos in the body of the article, and one as a heading image",
            "max_tokens": "1200",
            "category": "Space Exploration",
            "active": "1"
        }
    ]
}
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Understanding the Image Placeholder**
The `{img_unsplash:keyword1,keyword2,keyword3}` tag inside the content is used to fetch images dynamically from Unsplash. When the program processes the article:
1. It extracts the keywords inside `{img_unsplash:}`.
2. It queries Unsplash using those keywords.
3. It automatically places the retrieved images in the article content.
4. One image is set as the **featured image**, while at least two more are inserted within the article.

### **ðŸ”¹ Automatic Model Attribution**
At the end of each AI-generated article, the plugin **automatically adds a note** stating the AI model used (e.g., `Generated with GPT-4o-mini`) to ensure transparency and avoid confusion with original news.

## ðŸ’¡ TODO (Upcoming Features)
- **Integrate Pexels API for image fetching.**
- **Support for more image sources (e.g., Pixabay, Adobe Stock).**
- **Multi-language support for AI-generated content.**
- **Add an index page for all generated posts.**
