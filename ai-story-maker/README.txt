## ðŸ“œ Guide to Writing a Sample Prompt
The plugin supports structured prompts to generate AI content effectively. Below is a sample JSON configuration with explanations:

### **ðŸ”¹ Understanding the Image Placeholder**
The `{img_unsplash:keyword1,keyword2,keyword3}` tag inside the content is used to fetch images dynamically from Unsplash. When the program processes the article:
1. It extracts the keywords inside `{img_unsplash:}`.
2. It queries Unsplash using those keywords.
3. It automatically places the retrieved images in the article content.
4. One image is set as the **featured image**, while at least two more are inserted within the article.

### **ðŸ”¹ Automatic Model Attribution**
At the end of each AI-generated article, the plugin **automatically adds a note** stating the AI model used (e.g., `Generated with GPT-4o-mini`) to ensure transparency and avoid confusion with original news.

## ðŸ“œ Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: How do I configure API keys?**
A: Navigate to **AI Story Maker Settings** and enter your OpenAI and Unsplash API keys.

**Q: Can I customize the article format?**
A: Yes, you can modify the system prompt to change the output structure.
