== Description ==

AI Story Maker is a powerful WordPress plugin that generates unique, engaging stories and articles with intelligently matched images. It uses OpenAI for content creation and Unsplash for visuals, empowering bloggers, marketers, educators, and creatives to scale content creation with ease.

You can manage a library of prompts, auto-generate or review AI-generated posts, and control whether content is saved as a draft or published directly. Includes logging, dynamic story display, and attribution features.

== Features ==

- Generate original stories and articles using OpenAIâ€™s GPT models.
- Automatically fetch royalty-free visuals from Unsplash.
- Build and manage a prompt library with publishing rules.
- Automatically include model attribution at the end of each article.
- Track generation activity and errors with a log system.
- Admin interface for editing prompts, managing API keys, and running generations.
- Story Scroller display for frontend story showcasing.

1. Upload the plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install via the Plugin Installer.
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu in WordPress.
