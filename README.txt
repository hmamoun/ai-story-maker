== After Installing ==

The plugin operates through subscription packages that provide AI generation credits and features:

1. **Subscribe to Packages** – Choose from various subscription packages including free options that provide credits for AI story generation.

2. **Alternative: Use Own API Keys** – Advanced users can configure their own OpenAI and Unsplash API keys in the settings if preferred.

3. **Configure Your Preferences** – Set up story generation settings, select authors, and customize your content strategy.

The plugin saves your domain and email to maintain subscription integrity and communicate important updates to your subscription email.

== Story Generation Settings ==

- **Log Retention (Days)**: Define how long logs are kept. Set `0` to retain them indefinitely.
- **Generate New Stories Every (Days)**: Schedule AI story creation automatically every few days.
- **Select Story Author**: Choose a WordPress user to assign as the author of AI-generated content.

== Managing Prompts ==

The **Prompt Editor** allows you to build and control the instructions the AI follows.

### How to Add a New Prompt

1. Go to **AI Story Maker > Prompt Editor**.
2. Click **Add New Prompt**.
3. A new empty row appears.
4. Fill in:
   - **Prompt Text** (the instruction for the AI)
   - **Category** (WordPress category to publish in)
   - Other options (e.g., Auto-publish, Author, Photo placeholders)

> **Remember**: After adding, editing, or deleting prompts, you must click **Save Changes** to confirm.

### How to Delete a Prompt

- Click the **Delete** button beside the prompt.
- The row will be marked for deletion.
- Press **Save Changes** to complete.

### General Instructions vs Prompt Text

- **General Instructions**: Global rules applied to **all** prompts (e.g., article length, tone).
- **Prompt List**: Specific prompts that generate different content topics individually.

General Instructions are combined automatically with each prompt during generation.

== Displaying Generated Stories ==

### Primary Display: Posts Widget with Search and Filter

The main way to display your generated stories is through the posts widget shortcode that provides search and filter capabilities:

**[aistma_posts]** - Displays a searchable and filterable grid of your AI-generated posts

You can add this shortcode:
- In any WordPress page or post
- Inside a shortcode block
- In a widget area that supports shortcodes
- In a PHP template file using: echo do_shortcode('[aistma_posts]');

The widget automatically includes:
- Search functionality
- Category filtering
- Post thumbnails with images
- Responsive grid layout
- Ajax pagination

### Additional Display Options

AI Story Maker saves AI-generated content as regular WordPress posts. 
This means your stories will appear automatically wherever your theme displays posts, such as:

- Blog pages
- Post archives
- Menus and featured content areas

=== Shortcode: [aistma_scroller] ===

The shortcode [aistma_scroller] displays a dynamic scrolling bar of the latest AI-generated stories.

You can add the shortcode:
- In any WordPress page or post
- Inside a shortcode block
- In a widget area that supports shortcodes
- In a PHP template file using: echo do_shortcode('[aistma_scroller]');

=== How to Use ===

1. Edit a page or post in WordPress.
2. Add a new Shortcode Block (or paste directly).
3. Enter: [aistma_posts] for the main display or [aistma_scroller] for the scrolling bar
4. Save the page.

The displays adapt to your site's theme styles automatically. Additional CSS customization is possible if needed.

=== Important Notes ===

- Both shortcodes are fully responsive for mobile devices.
- Normal WordPress post listings are not affected.

== How AI Story Maker Retrieves General Instructions ==

AI Story Maker dynamically fetches the general AI system instructions from the Exedotcom API Gateway instead of hardcoding them inside the plugin.
	-	The plugin makes a secure HTTP request to retrieve the latest best-practice instructions.
	-	If the request fails or returns no data, a default internal fallback is used to ensure smooth operation.
	-	The retrieved instructions are cached temporarily to minimize remote calls and enhance performance.
	-	Allows future improvements and best practices without needing plugin updates.
	-	Ensures the generated articles continue to follow the latest content structure and SEO guidelines.

Privacy note:
	-	The plugin saves your domain and email to maintain subscription integrity and communicate updates.
	-	Only the site URL and server IP address are transmitted for simple tracking and security purposes.
	-	See our API terms of service at https://exedotcom.ca/api-terms (optional link if you plan to add later).
